---------------------------

As an engineer, I am constantly in awe of the systems we find in nature.


My current works involves using synthetic biology and next-generation sequencing to interrogate sub-population growth and drug response dynamics in TNBC. This is carried out in the [Brock Lab](https://www.brocklab.com) at the University of Texas at Austin. You can see more of this and previous work [here](../publications).

In my spare time, I foray into various programming projects. Such as this site which was built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on [github](https://github.com/DaylinMorgan/website).
